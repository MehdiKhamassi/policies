# Writing guidelines

## Foreword

This page provides guidance about preparing a submission for ReScience X, including the types of submissions we distinguish,  key aspects that must be covered in any submission, and the structure we expect submissions and supplementary material to adhere to.

ReScience X is organised in Sections, and our submission platform follows the [OJS submission workflow](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/authoring). Authors are advised to go through the OJS documentation, and can even take [a short online training module](https://pkpschool.sfu.ca/courses/writing-for-publication/), if needed.

## Types of submissions

### Reproductions of methods -- "The method is the same, results are, hopefully, consistent"

We refer to the definition of reproducibility proposed by Peng (2011): the purpose of a reproduction is to assert the outcome of a particular experimental setup, to assert a given method achieves consistent results.

In other words, a reproduction is an account of the faithful application of the original work; if at all possible, that means the same setup, the same scripts, the same software, the same stimuli and apparatus, the same kind of participants or subjects, the same chemical compounds, the same kind of equipment and facilities, the same analyses, etc. This may be more easily done in some disciplines than others. This would include, for instance, the measurement of chemical reactions, with raw material that will be of the exact same composition as in the original experiment.

### Replications of results -- "The method can be different, results are exactly the same"

While reproducibility is considered a minimal standard to evaluate a scientific claim, replicability (of results) is often considered the ultimate standard by which a result can be trusted.

The purpose of a replication is to assert a trait or a property that may be considered as universal, within a particular context. A replication is an account of the attempt to perform a similar experiment as presented in the original paper; unlike a reproduction, a replication needs not be as faithful, as it is understood that some aspects of the original work cannot be reproduced, or actually need to be tested differently. For instance, an experiment in linguistics on English participants, may not qualify as a reproduction if it is performed on German participants. Similarly, an experiment that relies on the use of particular piece of equipment does not qualify as a reproduction, if it is performed on a similar piece of equipment but produced by a competing manufacturer, which may be performing measurements completely differently.

### Re-analyses
The purpose of a re-analysis is to assert the knowledge gained from a given dataset, either reproducing the same analyses, by means of a different methodology, or pooling different sources of data together. Not all science needs be producing new data, and we strongly encourage the recycling of data, with a view to formulating new insights.

### Open letters / Editorials
The purpose of an open letter / editorial is to provide authors with the room to share their experience of a given field. The replication of research is a sensitive topic, because of the way scientific research is evaluated by funding agencies, academic institutions and the general public.

### Reviews
The purpose of a review is to assimilate the knowledge of a large body of work, to assist the formulation of a coherent, comprehensive and stable building block in the edifice of science. Reviews can take several forms, dictated by shared practices in academic communities.
All reviews must include a one-page summary accessible to a lay audience.


### Peer review policy

ReScience X follows a strict open peer review scheme, whereby reviewers of papers submitted are disclosed to the authors. The workflow is based on implementation by the Centre for Open Science. A submission “unit” is a Project in the Open Science Framework, containing links and hooks to all the material necessary to the submission. Pre-registrations are immutable, timestamped snapshots of OSF Projects, and the entire review process is logged and made public upon acceptance for publication. Authors retain control of the Project after publication, but published papers are themselves immutable, timestamped snapshots of the OSF Project, which are publicly available, searchable and indexed. Open comments to registered users are moderated.

Whenever possible, we strongly encourage authors of replications to engage with the authors of the replicated work, even before they invest efforts to produce new data. We also recognise that direct collaboration is not always possible, and therefore seek to foster collaborative, open, dispassionate and purposeful dialogue.


### Submission and review guidelines

A step-by-step guide to submitting work to ReScience X is available.
A submission must include a cover letter and a manuscript, and may include data, scripts, source code, software and images/VMs, amongst other things. Wherever applicable, authors are encouraged to provide as much detail and material to allow for the reproduction of their work—that is the faithful reproduction of the work and data.
